# React + TypeScript + Vite + SWC + Cesium

## Token
Your access token can be found at: https://cesium.com/ion/tokens    
If you don't have one you can create a free account and get one.

Once you have a token, set up a file called dontcheckin.ts in src/

The contents of src/dontcheckin.ts should look like
```aiignore
export const ACCESS_TOKEN = 'blahblahblah.secretstuf.blahblah';
```

## Get Started
```aiignore
nvm use    
npm i
npm run dev    
```
